I am a mathemetician, so it is befitting I speak on it. I will define two objects that are very important to me mathematically.
I also get to use this as an opportunity to test out MathJax integration in Jekyll for making my website. For the programmers, I added the block 

````html
 <!-- MathJax configuration -->
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [['\\(', '\\)'], ['$', '$']],
      displayMath: [['\\[', '\\]'], ['$$', '$$']]
    },
    options: {
      skipHtmlTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre', 'code']
    }
  };
</script>
````

to my _site/index.html file in my website repo.
