My name is William E. Mahaney, but I go by Will and sign WEM for short. I am a Mathematics graduate student at Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) in Blacskburg, Virginia in the United States.

In this blog I hope to record my thoughts and opinions on the mathematical and cyber worlds. I am also actively building my website and learning more about web design, database management, blog hosting etc. and this blog can serve as "patch notes" for this process. Maybe one day someone reads this blog and can avoid a mistake I made.
