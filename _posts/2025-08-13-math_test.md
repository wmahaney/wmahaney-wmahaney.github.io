I am a mathemetician, so it is befitting I speak on it. My primary area is Number Theory, specifically supersingular elliptic curves and Post-Quantum Cryptography. I also integrate Probability Theory with Number Theory and study random properties of arithmetic.

I also get to use this as an opportunity to test out MathJax integration in Jekyll for making my website. For the programmers, I added the block

````html
 <!-- MathJax configuration -->
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [['\\(', '\\)'], ['$', '$']],
      displayMath: [['\\[', '\\]'], ['$$', '$$']]
    },
    options: {
      skipHtmlTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre', 'code']
    }
  };
</script>
````

to my _site/index.html file in my website repo.

Now I will present a fun fact.

# Number Theory

**Fact**: A prime $p \ge 3$ can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

Proof:
$(\rightarrow)$ Suppose $p=x^2+y^2$. Computation mod 4 reveals $z^2 \equiv 0, 1 \pmod{4}$ for all integers $z$. Then $p \pmod{4} \equiv x^2 + y^2 \pmod{4}$ is equal to 0, 1, or 2 mod 4. As $p$ is an odd prime $p$ must be 1 mod 4.

$(\leftarrow)$ Suppose $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ is prime. As $p$ is an odd prime $p$ is not ramified in the Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. As $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ the prime $p$ splits in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ so we can factor $p = (a+ib)(a-ib)$ and consequently $p = a^2 + b^2$.
$\square$
